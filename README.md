# Java-Restful-Web-Services
Java Restful Web Service JAXRS CRUD Example Using Jersey and Maven build


This tutorial is for understanding the Behavior of Restful Web Services. Here I have used Maven based project for Jersey POM Dependency file.

# Let me Enlist few steps for Creating Maven based WebApp project first.
  
  Step 1. Click on file --> New --> Maven project -->  Select the work Space --> Click Next -->Filter Artifect Id (maven-archtype-webapp).
  
  Step 2. Click Next --> Enter Group Id (Group id will help you to identify your project uniquely among all projects). Group Id generaly   start with package name Rules wiz. com.Ervishal95 etc. 
  
  Step 3. Now Enter the Artifect Id. Artifect Id is generaly the name of JAR without Version, Project Name we used is of same name.
  
  Step 4. By Defalut 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT is your version. One can change the version is project is distributed.
  
  Step 5. Enter Finish.
  
And with these simple steps we have created our first maven project.

Once we have created the project, then we need to add required Dependencies in POM file of maven project. 
  Note:- Dependencies can be search on this URL:- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.jersey/jersey-json

Create the WEB.XML file as per the updated dependencies in POM File.
